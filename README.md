![Maven Central Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/dev.tunnicliff/lib-replace_me-android)

Template as a base for all my Android libraries.
Project contains the library `lib/` and a demo app `app/`.

After generating the repository:

- find all cases of `replace_me` and rename them.
- Edit the above jitpack badge address.

## Disclaimer

This project are open source and open to anyone to use as they see fit.
But I am building these with myself as the main target audience.
